/**
 * The six tools that change something on WhatsApp: sending text and files, reacting, marking read,
 * editing and revoking.
 *
 * Every one of them is deliberately thin — one client call, one shaper — because all the judgement
 * lives at the other end of it. The API is what resolves a recipient, requires a socket, refuses a
 * path outside `WHATSAPP_SEND_FILE_DIR`, enforces the upload cap and feeds the sent message back
 * through ingest. Duplicating any of that here would give a second, subtly different copy of a rule
 * that has to hold in exactly one place — and this side of the split cannot even see the facts it
 * would need: which chats exist, whose name is ambiguous, what is on the API's disk.
 *
 * That includes "exactly one of `data`/`path`", which the API refuses with the same two sentences
 * this layer used to produce, word for word. A local pre-check would be a second author of a
 * refusal that already has one.
 *
 * Three conventions:
 *
 * 1. **A handler never throws.** Every failure comes back as a `failedResult`: one readable line to
 *    the model, one log line to the operator. An exception escaping into the MCP SDK becomes a
 *    protocol error the model cannot read, and it would take the tool call's identity with it.
 * 2. **This module is gated, not conditional.** `buildMcpServer` registers it only when the API
 *    reports a writable deployment, so a read-only one does not advertise these six tools at all
 *    rather than advertising them and refusing every call. The flag arrives from
 *    `GET /v1/capabilities` per session, so flipping the API takes effect on the next connect.
 *    It is a courtesy, not the enforcement: the API refuses a write with `read_only` regardless.
 * 3. **No JID is interpreted here** (Global Constraint 11): a caller-supplied `chat` goes to the
 *    API verbatim, and `canonicalId` is applied at that boundary and nowhere else.
 *
 * **An ambiguous recipient still reads exactly as it did.** The refusal's message already carries
 * the numbered list of matches, so `describeError` renders the same sentences it always has; what
 * is new is `details.candidates` on the error, a machine-readable copy of that list, which a
 * programmatic client can render without parsing prose. Nothing here has to build it.

 * from what a human said — so it accepts a name too, and the refusal that follows an ambiguous name
 * settles it by naming an id to re-send this same field as.
 *
 * **There is no `pick` companion, and this description is why it had to go.** A `pick: <n>` indexing
 * the refusal's numbered list used to live here, and this text is what steered a model onto it. The
 * refusal and the retry are two round trips, the API's store is rewritten by incoming WhatsApp
 * traffic in between, and a position therefore named a different human on the retry than in the
 * refusal that offered it — a private message to the wrong person, silently, reported as a success.

 * `whatsapp_send_file`'s arguments, as one flat object with `data` and `path` both optional.
 *
 * Not a discriminated union — that renders as a top-level `anyOf`, which several MCP clients present
 * badly — and **not** a `.refine()`d object either. A refinement makes the schema a `ZodEffects`, and
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0` cannot describe one: `normalizeObjectSchema` reaches for
 * `.shape`, a `ZodEffects` has none, and `listTools` falls back to its `EMPTY_OBJECT_JSON_SCHEMA` —
 * so the tool would advertise `{"type":"object","properties":{}}` and no client would ever learn
 * that `chat` exists, let alone `data`. (Verified against the installed sdk 1.30.0 + zod 3.25.76;
 * the call still *validates* against the effect, because `validateToolInput` falls back to the raw
 * schema, so the breakage is invisible from a server-side test that only checks that a bad call is
 * refused.)
 *
 * The "exactly one of data/path" rule is therefore enforced by the API and stated in both
 * descriptions. Nothing is lost by that: a refinement never appears in JSON Schema anyway, so it was
 * never machine-readable to a client in the first place.
 *
 * `path` names a file on the **API** host, which is the third and last of the sanctioned changes in
 * meaning across the split (spec §7.1): the variable is the API's, the disk is the API's, and there
 * is no longer any sense in which it could mean a file beside this process. The description says so.
