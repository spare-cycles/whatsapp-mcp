/**
 * The six read tools, over the typed client.
 *
 * Every input schema below — every `.describe()` string, `limitSchema`'s `.max(200).default(50)`,
 * the `messageFilterShape` both message tools share — is **copied verbatim** from the in-process
 * server this replaces. A model's view of these six tools does not change across the split, so
 * neither does a single character of what is advertised. `reads.test.ts` and the README both pin
 * them.
 *
 * That includes the wording of the descriptions, which still say a read "reads the local SQLite
 * store only, so it answers offline". It is not stale: the sentence describes the *deployment*, and
 * it is still true of it — the API answers all six from SQLite without touching the socket, so all
 * six keep working while the connection is down, mid-backoff, or logged out (Global Constraint 13).
 * What changed is which process holds the file, which is not a thing the sentence claims.
 *
 * Three conventions survive the move unchanged:
 *
 * 1. **Pagination is a round trip**, and the cursor is opaque. The overfetch that decides whether a
 *    `next_cursor` is warranted is the API's now — a client cannot ask SQLite for one more row —
 *    and a malformed cursor is still an error rather than a silent restart from page one: the API
 *    answers `bad_request` with the name `CursorError`, so what a model reads is unchanged.
 * 2. **Reaction counts ride on the row.** `Message.reactionCount` arrives filled, resolved by one
 *    grouped query server-side, so a page of fifty is one request rather than fifty-one.
 * 3. **A handler never throws.** Everything comes back as `page`/`jsonResult` or `failedResult`,
 *    because an exception escaping into the MCP SDK becomes a protocol error rather than something
 *    a model can read.
 *
 * **Two failures a model must be able to tell apart, and they already read differently.**
 * `ConnectionUnavailableError: WhatsApp connection unavailable: …` means WhatsApp is down and the
 * reads still work; `ApiUnreachableError: could not reach the API at <base>` means this process
 * cannot find its own backend and *nothing* works. `describeError` renders each class's own name,
 * which is what keeps them distinct without a mapping table here — the SDK's taxonomy is what pins
 * the two names, and `errors.test.ts` is what holds them to it.
 *
 * Nothing here interprets a JID (Global Constraint 11): `chat` and `sender` go to the API verbatim
 * and `canonicalId` is applied there, at the one boundary allowed to apply it.
