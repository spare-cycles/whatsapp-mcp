/**
 * The assembled server: which tools it advertises, and what the write and media tools do with what
 * the API hands back. Ported from `packages/api/src/mcp/server.test.ts`.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the linked in-memory MCP client, so a call is parsed by the SDK's own
 * schema validation before a handler ever sees it — which is the only way to see the tool list, and
 * the advertised argument schemas, that a real client would see. That matters more than it sounds:
 * the `whatsapp_send_file` schema test below catches a failure mode in which every tool call still
 * behaves correctly and the advertised schema is empty.
 *
 * **What the split changed here, and it is three things — no more.** The retired suite ran jimp,
 * ffmpeg and ffprobe against real files, because the conversion happened in-process. It happens in
 * the API now, so what this suite asserts is that the MCP reports the API's answer unaltered: the
 * derivative's bytes pass through byte for byte, and the summary's keys and their order are pinned
 * as a *string* rather than a deep-equal, since key order is part of what a model reads.
 *
 * 1. **The document branch reports `url` where it reported `path`** — spec §7.1's first sanctioned
 *    exception. The path named a location on the API's disk. Both document sub-branches change, PDF
 *    included, and the extraction-failure note is reworded to match.
 * 2. **`whatsapp_send_file`'s "exactly one of data/path" is the API's refusal now.** The retired
 *    tests asserted the MCP refused it; the MCP forwards it, deliberately, so that one layer
 *    authors the refusal. What is asserted here is the forwarding; the refusal itself is asserted
 *    against the real API in `packages/e2e`.
 * 3. **The write and media tools no longer see a `Sender` or a `MediaStore`.** "Each write tool
 *    calls its own sender method, with the chat and the message id in that order" becomes "calls its
 *    own *route*, with the chat and the message id in the right path parameters" — the same defect
 *    it was written to catch (two tools asserted identically, a transposed string pair that
 *    type-checks), against the seam that now exists.
 *
 * **Assertions that were dropped, and why.** Four groups, each naming behaviour that moved wholly
 * to the API and is covered by its own suite:
 *
 * - **The transcription cache.** `whatsapp_transcribe caches: a second call does not re-run
 *   whisper`, and the assertions that the result was written into `messages.transcript_model` /
 *   `transcript_language` and that a failed run cached nothing, all read a SQLite row and counted
 *   runs of a stub `Transcriber`. The cache lookup is inside `POST …/transcribe` now. What is left
 *   for this layer is that the tool spends exactly one round trip and never consults the row first,
 *   which is asserted.
 * - **The keyframe budget.** `imageBlocks(res).length === config.videoKeyframes` named a setting
 *   this process no longer holds; the count is `strip.frames.length`, decided by the side that owns
 *   the ceiling.
 * - **The converter's output.** `jpeg.length > 0` and the `bytes === statSync(pngPath).size` pair
 *   asserted what jimp and ffmpeg produced from a file built in `before`. The MCP re-encodes
 *   nothing, so what replaces them is byte equality against what the API answered — a strictly
 *   stronger statement about *this* layer, and a strictly weaker one about ffmpeg, which is
 *   `packages/api`'s `convert.test.ts`'s subject and not this file's.
 * - **`summary["path"]`**, in both document branches: exception 1 above.
