/**
 * Every query and body schema the route table names.
 *
 * Two properties make this file more than a list of fields.
 *
 * **Query schemas coerce; body schemas do not.** A body arrives as parsed JSON, so `false` is a
 * boolean and `5` is a number on both sides of the wire. A query string carries neither type: the
 * server sees `"false"` and `"5"`, and a plain `z.boolean()` would refuse every query the client
 * ever sends. So each query field is declared through one of the `*Param` helpers below, whose
 * *output* type is the value both sides work with and whose *input* accepts the string form the URL
 * carries. That keeps one schema honest for the client (validating before send) and the server
 * (parsing what Express handed it) instead of two that can drift.
 *
 * **No `limit` default lives here.** `.default(50)` would make `limit` a *required* field of
 * `z.infer`, and the generated client method types its `query` argument with exactly that — so
 * `client.listChats({ query: {} })` would stop compiling and every caller would have to restate a
 * default it does not care about. The default belongs to the handler, which is also where the
 * ceiling that goes with it is enforced.
