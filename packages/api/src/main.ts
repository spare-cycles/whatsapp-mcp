/**
 * Bootstrap: the one place the real objects are constructed and handed to each other.
 *
 * It owns wiring and nothing else. Every decision it looks like it is making — what a handler may
 * reach, when a socket reconnects, what `/health` says — belongs to the module being wired, and the
 * two exceptions here (`loadMessage`, which adapts a Baileys key to a repository lookup, and
 * `shutdown`, which is process-level by nature) are named as such below.
 *
 * **Failure policy, inverted from the retired stdio server on purpose.** `uncaughtException` and
 * `unhandledRejection` are logged and the process keeps running. That server spoke to one client
 * over a pipe, so dying was honest; this one holds the only WhatsApp connection in the deployment
 * and serves every client over HTTP, so taking it down over one bad request drops the socket, the
 * ingest stream and every other session with it. A crash loop is not a recovery strategy when
 * reconnecting costs a fresh handshake with WhatsApp.
 *
 * A boot failure is the opposite case and still exits non-zero: nothing is running yet, so there is
 * nothing to protect, and a container that stays up with no server in it is worse than one that
 * restarts.
