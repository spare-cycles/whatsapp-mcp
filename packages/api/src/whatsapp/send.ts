/**
 * Every mutating WhatsApp operation: sending text and files, quoting, reacting, marking read,
 * editing and revoking.
 *
 * Two rules shape it. Every raw JID goes through `jid.ts` (Global Constraint 11) — there is no
 * `@`-splitting, no server matching and no suffix stripping here. And every call that produces a
 * message hands that message straight back to `ingest.ingestMessage` (Invariant 2), which is why a
 * sent message needs no separate mapping: it takes the same path an inbound one does.
 *
 * Baileys feeds its own copy of the same message through `messages.upsert` (`emitOwnEvents` defaults
 * to true). For `sendText` and `sendFile` the two writes are the same idempotent upsert, so the
 * duplication is deliberate rather than a hazard, and either one alone would leave the row correct.
 *
 * **That is not true of `react`, `editMessage` and `deleteMessage`,** and the symmetry here should
 * not be read as saying it is. Each of those three produces a *control stanza* — a `reactionMessage`
 * or a `protocolMessage` — which `ingest.ingestMessage` drops on sight (`ingest.ts`'s
 * `CONTROL_CONTENT`), so the re-ingest below is a no-op for them. What actually records the emoji,
 * the new text or the tombstone is Baileys' own `upsertMessage` → `processMessage`, which turns that
 * stanza into `messages.update` / `messages.reaction`. Turn `emitOwnEvents` off and those three stop
 * updating the store entirely; only the text and file sends would survive it.
 *
 * The three `reingest()` calls stay anyway, deliberately. What is storable is `ingest.ts`'s decision,
 * not this module's — that is why `CONTROL_CONTENT` lives there and why the drop happens there — and
 * omitting the call at three sites would quietly move that policy here, so a later change to what
 * counts as control would have to be made in two files instead of one. The cost is one dropped call
 * per control send.
