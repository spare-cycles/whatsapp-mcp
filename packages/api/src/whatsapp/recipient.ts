/**
 * Turning what a caller *called* someone into the chat id the store keys on.
 *
 * A model reading a conversation has a JID for every chat it saw, and for those this module is a
 * pass-through. It exists for the other case — "send this to Marie" — which the old server supported
 * and which is how a person actually names a recipient. Losing it would have made every send a
 * two-step dance through `whatsapp_contacts_search`, and a model that skipped the first step would send to
 * whatever it guessed.
 *
 * Two rules shape it:
 *
 * 1. **Ambiguity is refused, never guessed.** Two people named Marie is the normal case, and picking
 *    one sends a private message to the wrong person — the single most damaging thing this server can
 *    do. The refusal names the candidates and prints each one's id.
 * 2. **The retry is addressed by id, never by position.** The refusal and the retry are two separate
 *    requests, and ingest writes `chats` and `contacts` continuously in between — a `contacts.upsert`
 *    or a `linkIdentity` landing in that window inserts or collapses a row. A positional handle
 *    (`pick: 2`, which this module used to accept) therefore named a *different human* on the retry
 *    than in the refusal that offered it, silently and with a success response. Ordering the list by
 *    a total order over the data made the numbering deterministic given fixed data; it could not make
 *    the data fixed. An id is derived from the row rather than from the list, so nothing arriving in
 *    the window can move it — which is why `pick` is gone rather than repaired.
 *
 * No JID is interpreted here (Global Constraint 11): `parseRecipient` and `canonicalId` in
 * `whatsapp/jid.ts` do that, and this module works with the opaque ids they return.

 * never been messaged from this account. A person in both must appear once, which is what the id
 * dedupes on — otherwise every contact you have also messaged would be a two-way ambiguity.
 *
 * The `canonicalId` call is uniformity rather than a fix for a reachable bug: `linkIdentity` re-keys
 * both repositories when a LID mapping arrives, so neither is expected to hand back a LID that has a
 * phone JID. It stays because every id crossing a boundary in this codebase goes through it, and an
 * exception here would be the thing a later change quietly relies on.
 *
 * Exported for `rest/handlers/writes.ts`, which needs the list itself rather than the one id
 * `resolveRecipient` chooses from it: `POST /v1/recipients/resolve` answers with it, and an
 * `ambiguous_recipient` refusal carries it as `details.candidates`. Re-deriving it there rather
 * than parsing it back out of the refusal message is what keeps the ids a client is offered and the
 * ids the resolver will accept on the retry the product of one function.
