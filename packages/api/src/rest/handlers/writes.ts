/**
 * The eight routes that change something: the six sends, transcription, and the recipient lookup a
 * UI needs to build a picker.
 *
 * **`readOnly` is enforced here, and this is the only place it is enforced.** A separate process
 * cannot be trusted to police itself: the MCP additionally *discovers* the flag so it never
 * advertises a tool that cannot work, but that is a courtesy layered on top of this gate, not a
 * substitute for it. The gate covers exactly the six sends — a read-only deployment refuses every
 * one of them here, whatever the caller. `transcribe` and `resolveRecipient` are
 * deliberately outside it: `whatsapp_transcribe` lives in `registerMediaTools` and answers today in
 * a read-only deployment, and resolving a recipient sends nothing at all.
 *
 * **An ambiguous recipient is refused, never guessed.** `whatsapp/recipient.ts` does the refusing;
 * what this layer adds is the machine-readable half — `details.candidates`, each carrying the `id`
 * the refusal tells the caller to re-send `recipient` as, in the resolver's own total order (Global
 * Constraint 11). The candidates are re-derived from `candidatesFor` rather than parsed out of the
 * message, so the ids a client reads and the ids the resolver will accept on the retry are produced
 * by one function.
 *
 * **`react`'s `emoji` takes no `.min(1)`, on the wire schema or here.** An empty string is how
 * WhatsApp models *removing* a reaction; the obvious improvement deletes the removal path.
